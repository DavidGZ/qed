- bug: redraw problems on MagiC Mac
- switch to cvs/gcc
- alert if "save as" and a block is selected (ask if block or whole text). I 
  think the simple text "Save Block as" in the file selector is too dangerous. 
  Afair I stepped into this trap myself a few years ago.
- Show found text in find in files window. Hilight the found text. Jump to the 
  found text directly.
- popup menus (find, find in files...)
- configurable Project management - most probably by resource files.
- integrate the syntax and the local options into one dialog. Possibility to 
  set syntax file masks directly from within qed.
- free makeup (aligned to window width)
- highlight asm labels in the complete text
