Readme V.5.0 beta English

   From version 3.09 qed (including sources) will be in the public domain!

Thus, both the program and the sources of version 3.09 may be copied 
by everybody and may be freely distributed by bulletin board systems 
etc.
Yet the Tom has prohibited the charge of a fee of whatever kind.

=========================================================================

From Version 3.20 to Version 4.53 Christian Felsch was the maintainer of QED.

=========================================================================


From Version 5.0 beta on I, Heiko Achilles, have taken on the maintenance of 
QED.

This archive only contains some preliminary English translations: this readme, 
the resource file and the translated syntax.cfg.

The hypertext is still at work; additionally I have to contact Guido Flohr, 
who was the maintainer for the English translation of the hypertext. I think 
a preliminary version will be available in a few days.

For the use of QED you will need to download the complete (German) version and 
replace the files in this archive with the according English translations.

Because currently I've got a "temporarily" mail address only, please look on 
http://heinisoft.atari-users.net for the recent address. Sorry for the 
inconvenience; this will change soon.
